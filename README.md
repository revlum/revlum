👋 Hi, we’re @revlum, an adtech company that's working towards revolutionizing the way advertisers engage with their audiences. We're developing cutting-edge solutions that enable advertisers to leverage highly targeted offers, helping them meet their user acquisition and monetization goals.

👀 We’re deeply interested in technologies and techniques that drive meaningful and measurable ad engagement. This extends to everything from data analytics and AI to user experience and ad tech strategies. We love exploring how these various components can come together to create more effective and user-friendly ad experiences.

🌱 We're currently learning more about machine learning and big data analytics. These fields hold immense potential for adtech, particularly in helping businesses create personalized ad experiences. By harnessing the power of these advanced technologies, we aim to enhance ad engagement and deliver superior value to our advertisers.

💞️ We’re looking to collaborate on open-source adtech projects, particularly those that push the boundaries of current technologies and methodologies. If you're developing a project that seeks to innovate in the adtech space, we'd love to explore how we could contribute to it.
